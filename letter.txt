Hello!
I hope this message finds you well.

I'm Christofher, founder of Wisepace, and previously a board member and founder of LookinLabs, as well as a former student at Tallinn Polytechnic College. At Wisepace, we provide mentoring services focused on a "work-based" learning approach that prepares students for real-world IT roles. Our program includes task management through Jira, weekly mentorship meetings, collaborative projects with fellow developers, and thorough code reviews from industry experts.

We're not looking to compete with academies; instead, we're interested in a partnership that complements curriculum of other academies, helping to strengthen students' industry readiness and contribute positively to the future of the IT job market.

If you're open to exploring this further, could we arrange a call to discuss potential collaboration?
